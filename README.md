📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.
It predicts the output based on the K closest data points in the dataset.

🔹 How It Works

Choose the value of K (number of neighbors).

Calculate the distance between the new point and all training points.

Select the K nearest neighbors.

For classification → Majority voting

For regression → Average of neighbors

🔹 Key Features

Non-parametric (no assumption about data distribution)

Lazy learning (no explicit training phase)

Distance-based algorithm (Euclidean commonly used)

Sensitive to feature scaling

🔹 Common Distance Formula (Euclidean)
